Scope of the Project:
1.	Mortgage Lending Prediction
Develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of mortgage approval based on historical applicant data, financial metrics, and market conditions.
2.	Feature Insights
Identify key factors influencing mortgage approval, such as credit scores, income, debt-to-income ratios, property values, and more.
3.	Model Deployment
Implement the model in a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions, ensuring scalability and integration with financial systems.

Key Components:
1.	Data Collection
o	Sourced anonymized datasets of past mortgage applications from public repositories or financial partners.
o	Key features include:
	Applicant demographics
	Credit history
	Employment data
	Loan amount and tenure
	Property valuation
2.	Data Preprocessing
o	Handled missing values using mean imputation and predictive modeling.
o	Standardized numerical features and performed one-hot encoding for categorical data.
o	Balanced the dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Explored trends in mortgage approvals based on credit score thresholds, income ranges, and market conditions.
o	Visualized data distributions, correlations, and outlier detection using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
4.	Model Development
o	Tested machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting.
o	Fine-tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.
o	Selected the best model based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
5.	Model Evaluation
o	Achieved an accuracy of over 90% and a precision score of 85% for predicting approvals.
o	Ensured ethical considerations to mitigate bias in predictions.
6.	Deployment
o	Deployed the model using Flask, integrating it with a dashboard for real-time predictions.
o	Enabled end-users to input applicant data and receive immediate insights into approval likelihood.
